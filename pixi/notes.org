* Experiments <2024-09-11 Wed>

** MacOS (<2024-09-11 Wed>)

all works well following [file:install-pixi-environment.sh] with the exception of:

- spyder doesn't start:

  /Users/fangohr/git/python-installation-for-teaching/pixi/.pixi/envs/default/bin/pythonw: line 3: /Users/fangohr/git/python-installation-for-teaching/pixi/.pixi/envs/default/python.app/Contents/MacOS/python: No such file or directory

  This is a known bug:
  https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/22386 with the
  python.app application, and can be manually fixed by editing a file.

  Once this is done, spyder starts fine.

** Windows 11 (<2024-09-11 Wed>)

- pixi installer needs to be run in powershell

- afterwards, pixi command is available in ~cmd~ and ~powershell~

- install packages as in [file:install-pixi-environment.sh]

All works well following [file:install-pixi-environment.sh], jupyter
starts, but spyder reports a problem not finding the default kernel
when it starts. Didn't investigate further.
